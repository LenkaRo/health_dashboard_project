Notes from Government report

'In a vibrant, modern Scotland it should be possible for everyone to be as healthy as they can be.'

Priority 1: A Scotland where we live in vibrant, healthy and safe places and communities
Priority 2: A Scotland where we flourish in our early years
Priority 3: A Scotland where we have good mental wellbeing
Priority 4: A Scotland where we reduce the use of and harm from alcohol, tobacco and other drugs
Priority 5: A Scotland where we have a sustainable, inclusive economy with equality of outcomes for all
Priority 6: A Scotland where we eat well, have a healthy weight and are physically active

But it’s not primarily in our hospitals or our GP surgeries that health is first created. It is in our homes and our communities, in the places we live and through the lives we lead. These are the places where we must work to make it easier for people to be healthy, and the efforts of society as a whole must increasingly turn towards supporting this sort of ‘wellbeing creation’.
