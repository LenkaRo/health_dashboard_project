* Graph is showing the Life Expectancy in Scotland for females and males based on the year they were born
* LE is calculated using abridged life tables (= calculated for grouped ages) to allow for comparison with the subnational figures
* LE refers to the number of years that a person could expect to survive if the current mortality rates for each age group, sex and geographic area remain constant throughout their life
* The LE in Scotland for those born between 2016 and 2018 was 77.2 years for males and 81.2 years for females
* Both lines have a steady upward trend until the year of 2015, where we see a drop
* Regarding to nrscotland.gov.uk, this stall/drop in LE in Scotland is especially seen in some particular councils and correlates with SIMD (Scottish index of multiple deprivation) 
* The LE is used as indicator in monitoring and investigating health inequality issues within Scotland, setting public health targets, informing pensions policy, research and teaching
