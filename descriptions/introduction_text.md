## 

Designed in consultation and collaboration with Scottish Government representatives, this dashboard is intended to be primarily used by policy analysts, health-service professionals and education providers. Its dual purpose is to create a better understanding of certain public health indicators and to assist in the development of strategies that improve health outcomes across Scotland.


----------



**Content**

The content presented within this dashboard derives from two main sources:

1. Scotland's Public Health Priorities report produced in 2018 by the Scottish Government. The report outlines 6 Public Health Priorities (PHPs) that the government believe are most important to focus on over the next decade if we are to improve the health of the nation.
2. The second main source is the statistics.gov.scot website, which provided the majority of datasets used in the dashboard. Supplementary datasets from other sources have also been used. Specific dataset links are referenced in ****. 


----------

**Structure**

The dashboard contains two key tabs for the user to engage with:

1. The overview tab presents visualisations of relevant measures which relate to each of the 6 Public Health Priorities (PHPs). Users may select a certain measure and then learn how this measure relates to one of the PHPs. Visualisations of each of the measures are presented in order to give the user a broad understanding of recent historical progress towards the goals established by each of the PHPs.

2. The second key tab in our dashboard provides tools for a more detailed analysis of Asthma in Scotland. This section of the dashboard allows the user to explore measures such as deaths and rates of hospitalization where asthma was the primary cause of such events. Data is presented from Temporal, Geographic and Demographic perspectives. A small statistical analysis is also included and presented.
