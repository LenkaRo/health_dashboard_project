* The graph is showing a visualization of null distribution (generated by permutation), observed statistic and p-value related to our hypothesis established to answer the question:
* **Is there a significant difference between the population means of the asthma rates depending on the patient gender across the all Scottish Healthboards?**
	- Significance level: α = 0.05
	- Null hypothesis H0: μ(F) = μ(M)
	- Statistic: x(F) - x(M)
* The observed statistic (difference in population means) is passed the edge of the null distribution
	- result: p-value ≈ 0 (< 0.05)
* Conclusion: Based on our data samples, there was enough evidence to suggests there was a significant difference between average rates of females and males between years 2012 and 2019
