* This is a box plot showing a distribution of average asthma rate distribution among all NHS Health Boards.
* The inter-quartile ranges for both genders are overlaping yet the asthma rate range for females seems to be somewhat higher on average

* **Is there a significant difference between the population means of the asthma rates depending on the patient gender across the all Scottish Healthboards?**
* We have two independent samples of asthma rates observed between years 2012 and 2019 - for females and males and establish the hypothesis

	- Significance level: α = 0.05
	- Null hypothesis H0: μ(F) - μ(M) = 0
	- Statistic: x(F) - x(M)
