title: "Explore low birthweight"

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

# Read in data, skipping 9 rows of introduction
```{r}
birthweight <- read_csv(here("data/low-birthweight.csv"), skip = 9) %>% 
  clean_names()

birthweight %>% 
  filter(reference_area != "Scotland") %>%
#  mutate(area_code = str_remove_all("http://statistics.gov.scot/id/statistical-geography/", ref_area))
```

Visualise data - long load time.
```{r}
birthweight %>% 
  # arrange(desc(lb_count)) %>% 
  # head(30) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = reorder(reference_area, count), y = count) +
  geom_col()
```
Needs total number of births to give a proportion of low birthweight.
Needsa different way of grouping areas so we can see changes.
